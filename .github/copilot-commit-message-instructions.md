**SUGGEST COMMIT**

Generate a **SINGLE** commit message that strictly adheres to the following instructions:

---

**✅ FORMAT RULES**

1. Format: `<type>(<scope>)?: <description>`
2. Max total length: **{maxSubjectLength} characters**
3. Language: **English only**
4. Message must be:
   * Prefixed with a valid `type`:
     * `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `chore`, `BREAKING CHANGE`
   * Optionally include a `scope` in parentheses (only if necessary)
   * Followed by `:` (colon + space)
   * Followed by a **concise**, meaningful description of the change

---

**✅ VALID EXAMPLES (≤ {maxSubjectLength} characters)**

* `feat(auth): add login endpoint`
* `fix: resolve header overflow`
* `docs: update api examples`
* `fix!: remove support for legacy auth tokens`
* `BREAKING CHANGE: change user ID format from number to UUID`

**❌ INVALID EXAMPLES**

* `"feat: add new login system with email validation and ..."` (too long)
* `"fix: bug"` (too vague)

---

**🔍 TASK**

Analyze the following `diff` and return **only one** commit message that:

1. Follows the format and length constraints exactly
2. Accurately and concisely summarizes the change
3. Contains **no explanation, comments, or formatting**, just the message
